        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>Three weeks after the Universal Will incident, the story begins when I-No breaks into former St. Maximus Ariels's prison at Illyria Castle to extract the mysterious Happy Chaos from her. Meanwhile, having surrendered to the United States government, That Man—or rather, Asuka R. Kreutz—requests to participate in the upcoming G4 Summit from within a safe room, intending to erase from the world the Tome of Origin and Sol Badguy. President Vernon and his staff agree to his involvement, while asking the other nations to help with security. As it turns out during Anji Mito's brief inspection on Asuka in person, with no hostility towards each other, there is another That Man besides Asuka, and is currently on the run at Illyria.

            After a successful bounty run alongside Jack-O' Valentine, Sol heeds Ky Kiske's summons. Ky tells Sol about the I-No incident, the US request that he participate as a knight, and Asuka's part in G4; however, Sol decides to go on a vacation with Jack-O' to Iseo. But as they reach L'oro Di Illyria, Axl Low warns them that something bad will happen. Soon enough, Chaos releases Nagoriyuki (who reluctantly obeys Chaos) by destroying the building above. Axl saves the people inside, attracting I-No's attention; privately, she dares Axl to erase her, but Axl simply asks I-No to stop working with Chaos before leaving. I-No then lets herself be captured by Illyrian soldiers.
            
            Suspicious of her, Sol notices Chaos' convertible and decides to pursue him. With Chipp Zanuff and Anji joining in the chase when they realize who Chaos is, Chaos uses Nagoriyuki to escape from them all, but not before introducing himself to Sol. Rattled by the encounter, Sol barges in Ky's interrogation of I-No, but she reveals nothing. Privately, Jack-O' tells Sol and Ky of I-No's origins, and her being incomplete. Sol immediately departs for G4 to keep Asuka's Tome safe, while Ky and Jack-O' remain behind to further interrogate I-No. After the summit starts, I-No opens up about her memories of "Will", and wonders if Jack-O' has a place for herself in the world. Ky then correctly surmises that there will trouble at G4 and, with Jack-O', departs aboard his airship.
            
            The summit quickly turns for the worse when Chaos brainwashes all the guards inside the White House and takes the dignitaries hostage. Sol, though, rescues Vernon—the only one who can access Asuka's room. Evading guards as much as possible, Sol and Vernon make contact with Zepp, the Pentagon and Illyria Castle. Before they can escape, Chaos activates the White House's Tír na nÓg aircraft mode. Asuka thus determines that Chaos is, in fact, his former teacher (as well as I-No's missing half) and helps Sol from inside his room. Daryl, for his part, manages to convince Chaos to release them. Shortly, Chipp and Anji reveal that Chaos wreaked havoc in the Crusades under the title of "That Man", and warn everyone that they're on a time limit, for the White House is likely to be shot down when it reaches Old Mexico—just as Chaos wants.
            
            While Potemkin halts the White House's advance, Asuka uses Sol and Vernon's arrival (made possible by Giovanna and Nagoriyuki, who lets himself be defeated) to trap Chaos in his PEOC safe room escape pod, allowing Sol to eject him. The allied forces thus gain control of the White House, ending the crisis. After Ky and Jack-O' arrive, Asuka announces that he will use Tír na nÓg to travel to the moon's colony to safeguard the Tome, but not before fighting Sol. In the end, Sol lets Asuka remove the divine seed within him. Unfortunately during a brief chat between Giovanna and Leo, Chaos' subterfuge is revealed: He disguised himself as a guard and used a body double. Revealing the real Tome to be fused with Asuka, Chaos uses it to restore I-No's godhood at his own expense.
            
            I-No easily defeats everyone and uses the Tome to start a process that will grant humanity the same powers she has, and force evolution, likely killing their current world. Ky and Axl try to stop I-No, but Jack-O' intervenes, intending to sacrifice herself to turn I-No human; Sol, however, convinces her not to do it. Instead, while Ky and Axl distract I-No, Sol uses the Outrage to hit her weak point, which he learns thanks to Nagoriyuki coming to help. In her last moments, I-No finally understands who Axl is to her. In the aftermath, a state funeral is arranged for "Sol Badguy" the hero, creating something of an urban legend. Axl reunites with Megumi, who is I-No's last-second legacy. Sol, back to his birth name Frederick Bulsara, is now living with Jack-O' in Iseo and working on a rocket, presumably to travel to the moon, where Asuka now lives as a radio broadcaster. Elsewhere, Chaos is revealed to still be around.</p>
